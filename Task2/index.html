                has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                of
                type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                the
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
